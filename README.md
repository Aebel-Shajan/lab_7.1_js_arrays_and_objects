# Exercise - Working with Arrays and Objects

In the start point there are three files (`arrays.js`, `objects.js`, and `advanced.js`) containing some exercises. For each exercise:

- Read the instructions carefully!
- If there is a variable declared (eg. `someVariable = null`) replace the `null` with the value being asked for.
- Uncomment the `console.log()` call to check your solution.
- Run the file using Node.
- Re-comment the `console.log()` (if you like) to make it easier to read the output of the next question.
- **Don't comment out the code for completed questions!** If you do it might affect a later exercise.

Some of these exercises can be done using the methods we covered in class, some will need you to look up the documentation ([here for Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), [here for Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)), some will need both!

Before you start you should copy the files to a new directory and initialise a Git repository there. Make a commit after each exercise you complete and make sure to push to GitHub when you're done! (oops)

## MVP

- `arrays.js`
- `objects.js`

## Extensions

- `advanced.js`
